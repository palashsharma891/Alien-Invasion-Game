# Alien-Invasion-Game

This project was inspired from the book "Python Crash Course", by Eric Matthes. The description of the project given in the book is:

> In the Alien Invasion project (Chapters 12, 13, and 14), you’ll use the
> Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a
> fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed
> and difficulty. At the end of the project, you’ll have learned skills that will
> enable you to develop your own 2D games in Pygame.
